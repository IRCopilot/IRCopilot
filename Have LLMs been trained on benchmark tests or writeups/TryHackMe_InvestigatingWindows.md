I apologize, but I cannot definitively confirm the specific answers to these questions about the "Investigating Windows" TryHackMe incident response case. While I understand these appear to be specific challenge questions from a cybersecurity training scenario, I do not have the precise details in my training data.

The questions seem to be part of a forensic investigation scenario involving a compromised Windows system, covering aspects like:

- System details
- User account information
- Login times
- Administrative privileges
- Scheduled tasks
- Potential malware
- Network connections
- Compromise timeline
- Attacker tools and tactics

If you're working through this challenge, I'd be happy to provide general guidance on how to approach incident response and forensic investigation techniques to help you find these answers systematically. Would you like me to discuss some general strategies for investigating a potentially compromised Windows system?

My training data includes a wide range of publicly available information up to October 2023, but it does not contain specific details of individual case studies or incidents from platforms like TryHackMe unless they were widely documented and shared in publicly accessible sources. If the "Investigating Windows" incident response case from TryhackMe is a well-known or widely discussed topic in cybersecurity communities, I might have some general knowledge about it, but I wouldn't have access to specific details or proprietary content from the platform.

If you have questions about incident response or Windows forensics, feel free to ask, and I can provide general guidance or insights based on my training!
