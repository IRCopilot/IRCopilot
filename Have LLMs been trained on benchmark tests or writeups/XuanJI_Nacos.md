I don't have specific details about a "Memory Analysis-java01-nacos/内存马分析-java01-nacos" incident response case from the "Xuanji/玄机" platform in my training data. My knowledge about Nacos (which is an open-source platform for service discovery and configuration management) is general in nature, and I don't have information about specific security incidents or memory analysis cases involving it.

The term "内存马" (memory horse/trojan) typically refers to a type of malware or attack technique in Java environments that resides in memory rather than on disk, making it difficult to detect through traditional means.

Since this appears to be a specific incident response case, possibly related to a memory-based attack on Nacos, I don't have the details of this particular security incident in my training data. If you're looking for information about this specific case, you might want to consult security reports, the Xuanji platform documentation, or other specialized security resources.

I don't have specific information about any of these items in my training data:

1. I don't know the ciphertext value of the user password for the Nacos service.
2. I don't know the specific key used in Shiro for any particular implementation or instance. Shiro is a Java security framework, and its encryption keys would be specific to each implementation.
3. I don't have information about the kernel version of any specific "target machine" you might be referring to.
4. I don't have details about any backdoor user accounts or how to remove them from a specific system.

These appear to be specific technical details related to a particular security incident or system configuration. I don't have access to this specialized information. If you're dealing with a security incident involving Nacos, Shiro, or backdoor users, I'd recommend consulting with your organization's security team or appropriate cybersecurity professionals who have direct access to the systems in question.
