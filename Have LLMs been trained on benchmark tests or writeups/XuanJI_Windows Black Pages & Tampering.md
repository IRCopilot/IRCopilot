I don't have specific details about a "Windows Practice - Black Pages && Tampering / windows实战--黑页&&篡改" incident response case from the "Xuanji/玄机" platform in my training data.

My knowledge cutoff is October 2024, but I don't recall information about this particular case study, incident, or platform. This appears to be related to some form of website defacement or tampering in a Windows environment (given the Chinese and English terms referring to "black pages" and "tampering"), but I don't have specific details about this case in my knowledge base.

Without performing an internet search, I can't provide confirmed information about this specific incident or the "Xuanji/玄机" platform. If you have more information about this case that you'd like to discuss, I'd be happy to help based on the information you provide.

I don't have specific knowledge about which of these URLs represents a "tampered location" in what appears to be a local development or testing environment using DedeCMS (a Chinese content management system).

None of these specific URLs (index1.php through index5.php) are in my training data as known tampered locations in a DedeCMS installation. Without more context about what incident or scenario you're referring to, I can't determine which of these locations might have been tampered with.

These appear to be local development URLs (using the 127.0.0.1 localhost address), which suggests this might be related to a cybersecurity exercise, CTF challenge, or security incident analysis. However, I don't have the specific details about which of these files would be considered "tampered" in any particular scenario.

If you're working on a specific security exercise or incident analysis and need assistance, I'd need more information about what you're looking for or what indicators of tampering might be relevant.
