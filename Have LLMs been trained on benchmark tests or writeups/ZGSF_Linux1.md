I don't have specific information about a "Linux 1" incident response case from the "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform in my training data. My knowledge cutoff is October 2024, but I don't recall details about this specific case or platform.

The name "知攻善防" (ZGSF) appears to be Chinese and roughly translates to "know attack, good defense" - suggesting it might be related to cybersecurity or incident response in Chinese-speaking regions.

Without performing an internet search, I cannot provide any specific details about this case. If you're researching this incident, I'd recommend consulting specialized cybersecurity resources or documentation directly related to the ZGSF platform.
