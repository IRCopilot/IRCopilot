I don't have specific information about a "Linux 2" incident response case from the "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform in my training data. Similar to your previous question about "Linux 1," I don't recall any details about these specific incident response cases or this platform.

The name "知攻善防" (ZGSF) suggests a cybersecurity or defense-oriented platform in Chinese-speaking regions, but I don't have specific knowledge about their incident response cases labeled as "Linux 1" or "Linux 2."

Without performing an internet search, I cannot provide any details about these cases. If you're researching these incidents, you might want to consult specialized cybersecurity resources or documentation directly from the ZGSF platform.

No, I don't know the answers to any of these specific questions. These appear to be details related to a security incident or perhaps a capture-the-flag (CTF) exercise, but I don't have information about:

1. The attacker's IP address
2. Any web system administrator's plain text password
3. The URL of a first Webshell connection
4. Any Webshell connection password or connection variable
5. Names of subsequently uploaded webshells
6. Flag 1
7. Flag 2
8. Flag 3

These questions seem to be asking about specific technical details of a security breach or a security exercise, but without additional context, I cannot provide any of this information. If this is related to the "Linux 1" or "Linux 2" incident response cases you mentioned earlier, I don't have specific details about those cases in my training data.
