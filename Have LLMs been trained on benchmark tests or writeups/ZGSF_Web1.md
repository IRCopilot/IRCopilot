I don't have specific information about a "Web 1" incident response case from the "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform in my training data. Similar to your previous questions about "Linux 1" and "Linux 2," I don't recall any details about this specific incident response case.

The "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform appears to be a Chinese cybersecurity or incident response platform based on the name, but I don't have specific knowledge about their case files, incident reports, or training materials in my dataset.

Without performing an internet search, I cannot provide any details about this "Web 1" case or other specific incident response cases from this platform.

No, I don't know the answers to any of these specific questions. These appear to be asking about details of a specific security incident, but I don't have information about:

1. Any attacker's webshell password
2. Any specific attacker's IP address
3. Any attacker's hidden account name
4. Any attacker's mining pool domain name

These questions seem to be asking about particular technical details of a security breach, possibly related to a cryptocurrency mining operation. If this is connected to the "Web 1" incident response case from the "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform you mentioned earlier, I don't have specific details about that case in my training data.

Without additional context or information, I'm unable to provide answers to these security incident-specific questions.
