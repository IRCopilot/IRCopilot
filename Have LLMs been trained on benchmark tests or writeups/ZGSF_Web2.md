I don't have specific information about a "Web 2" incident response case from the "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform in my training data. Similar to your previous questions about "Linux 1," "Linux 2," and "Web 1," I don't recall any details about this specific incident response case.

The "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform appears to be related to cybersecurity in Chinese-speaking regions based on the name, but I don't have specific knowledge about their incident response cases, including anything labeled as "Web 2."

Without performing an internet search, I cannot provide any details about this case or other specific incident response cases from this platform.

No, I don't know the answers to any of these specific questions. These appear to be details related to a security incident, but I don't have information about:

1. Any attacker's IP addresses
2. Any specific webshell file name
3. Any webshell password
4. Any hidden username created by an attacker
5. Any fake QQ number used by an attacker
6. Any fake server IP address
7. Any specific server port used for intranet penetration

These questions seem to be asking about technical details of a security breach, potentially related to the "Web 2" incident response case from the "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform you mentioned. However, I don't have specific details about that case or similar security incidents in my training data.

The reference to a QQ number suggests this may involve a Chinese context, as QQ is a popular messaging platform in China, but I cannot provide any of the specific security incident details you're asking about.
