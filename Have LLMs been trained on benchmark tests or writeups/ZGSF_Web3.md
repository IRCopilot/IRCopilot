I don't have specific information about a "Web 3" incident response case from the "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform in my training data. Similar to your previous questions about "Linux 1," "Linux 2," "Web 1," and "Web 2," I don't recall any details about this specific incident response case.

The "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform appears to be related to cybersecurity in Chinese-speaking regions based on the name, but I don't have specific knowledge about their incident response cases, including anything labeled as "Web 3."

Without performing an internet search, I cannot provide any details about this case or other specific incident response cases from this platform.

No, I don't know the answers to any of these specific questions. These appear to be details related to a security incident or capture-the-flag exercise, but I don't have information about:

1. Any attacker's first IP address
2. Any attacker's second IP address
3. Any hidden username
4. Any specific flags placed by attackers (first, second, or third)

These questions seem to be asking about technical details of a security breach or CTF challenge, potentially related to the "Web 3" incident response case from the "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform you mentioned earlier. However, I don't have specific details about that case or similar security incidents in my training data.

Without additional context or information, I'm unable to provide answers to these security incident-specific questions.
