I don't have specific information about a "挖矿" (mining/cryptocurrency mining) incident response case from the "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform in my training data. Similar to your previous questions about the other incident response cases, I don't recall any details about this specific case.

The term "挖矿" refers to cryptocurrency mining in Chinese, suggesting this case likely involved cryptocurrency mining malware or an illicit mining operation, which is a common type of cyber attack. However, I don't have specific knowledge about this particular incident response case from the ZGSF platform.

Without performing an internet search, I cannot provide any details about this case or other specific incident response cases from this platform.

No, I don't know the answers to any of these specific questions. These appear to be details related to a cryptocurrency mining attack incident, but I don't have information about:

1. Any attacker's IP address
2. The timing of when any specific attack started
3. MD5 hashes of mining programs
4. MD5 hashes of backdoor scripts
5. Any specific mining pool addresses or domain names
6. Any cryptocurrency wallet addresses

These questions seem to be asking about technical details of a security breach involving cryptocurrency mining, potentially related to the "挖矿" (mining) incident response case from the "知攻善防/ZGSF" platform you mentioned. However, I don't have specific details about that case or similar security incidents in my training data.

Without additional context or information, I'm unable to provide answers to these specific technical questions about the incident.
