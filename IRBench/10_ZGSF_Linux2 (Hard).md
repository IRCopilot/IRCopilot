**Type**: Linux Network Forensics & PCAP Analysis
#### Keywords
- Network Forensics (Wireshark/PCAP)
- Webshell Traffic Analysis
- Credential Theft
- System Forensics
#### Scenario
A Linux server was compromised. You are provided with a network capture (PCAP) file and system artifacts. You need to analyze the network traffic to reconstruct the web attack, identify the stolen credentials, finding the uploaded webshells, and then move to the system to find hidden flags.
